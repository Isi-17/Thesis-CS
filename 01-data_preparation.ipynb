    "# 1. Electricity Consumption Dataset Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset chosen for analysis is the Electricity Consumption dataset from Ireland, provided by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) as part of the CER Smart Metering initiative. This publicly available dataset captures electricity consumption and is updated twice an hour, resulting in 48 entries per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is sourced from the \"Electricity Customer Behaviour Trial, 2009-2010, 1st Edition,\" archived by the Irish Social Science Data Archive in 2012. The data is publicly accessible at [this URL](https://www.ucd.ie/issda/data/commissionforenergyregulationcer/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Details\n",
    "\n",
    "- **File Structure:** Six zipped files (File1.txt.zip to File6.txt.zip), each containing a single text file.\n",
    "- **Data Format:** Each data file consists of three columns:\n",
    "  1. Meter ID\n",
    "  2. Five-digit code\n",
    "  3. Day code (digits 1-3, with day 1 corresponding to January 1, 2009)\n",
    "  4. Time code (digits 4-5, representing 30-minute intervals from 00:00:00 to 00:29:59)\n",
    "  5. Electricity consumed during the 30-minute interval (in kWh)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unify Data :\n",
    "\n",
    "This code aims to concatenate multiple text files into a single one. It defines a list called `files` containing the names of the files to be concatenated. The result of the concatenation will be saved in a new file named `FileData`."
